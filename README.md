# Effectively a Julia port of [NeuronUnitOpt](https://github.com/russelljjarvis/NeuronunitOpt)

This project glues together three repositories (2 Julia, 1 python) with the result that spiking neural [models expressed in Julia](https://github.com/AStupidBear/SpikingNeuralNetworks.jl) become amenable to python neuronunit/sciunit testing of model fitness and genetic algorith optimization.
